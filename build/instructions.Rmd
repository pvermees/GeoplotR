# Installation

1. Install `R` and `RStudio` from:
   
   [`https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download`](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

1. Start `RStudio` and install the `remotes` package by typing the
following code at the console (i.e. the '`>`'-symbol):

   ```{r eval=FALSE}
   install.packages('remotes')
   ```

1. Now install the latest beta version of the `GeoplotR` package by
typing the following commands at the console:

   ```{r eval=FALSE}
   remotes::install_github('https://github.com/pvermees/GeoplotR/')
   ```

1. Download `helpers.zip` from
[`github:pvermees/GeoplotR/build/`](https://github.com/pvermees/GeoplotR/blob/main/build/helpers.zip)
and unzip it to a folder on your computer. `helpers.zip` is an archive
that contains the following four files: `test.R`, `Template.json`,
`Cr_Y.json` and `QAP.json`, as well as a copy of these instructions.

# Getting started

1. You can open the three `json` files in `RStudio`. They contain the
following information:

   (a) `lines`: the coordinates of anchor points on a decision boundary

   (b) `line_type`: `solid`, `dashed` or `dotted` (one for each item in `lines`)

   (c) `polygons`: the coordinates of the corners of polygons whose edges
   overlap with the entries in `lines`

   (d) `label_coords`: the coordinates of the labels that are to be
   placed inside each of the polygons.

   (e) `labels`: the actual labels (one for each item in `label_coords`)

   (f) `angle`: the rotation angle of the labels (one for each item
   `label_coords`)

1. Open `test.R` in `RStudio` and click on `Session` $\rightarrow$
`Set Working Directory` $\rightarrow$ `To Source File Location`.

1. Click on the `Source` button. This should create a PDF document on
your computer, in the same folder as the `test.R` file. Inspect the
contents of the PDF document to understand what `test.R` has done.

1. Have a look at `Template.json` in `RStudio`:

   (a) make any change to any number in this file

   (b) save the file

   (c) go back to the `test.R` tab

   (d) click on `source` again.

   Do you notice any change in the PDF document?

1. `test.R` contains computer code in the `R` language. It uses two
functions of the `GeoplotR` package named `xytest` and `xyztest`,
respectively.  You can read more about these functions, and about
their arguments, in the built-in documentation, by typing the
following code at the console:

   ```{r eval=FALSE}
   ?xyplot
   ?xyzplot
   ```

# The actual job

1. Visit
[`https://minerva.union.edu/hollochk/c_petrology/discrim.html`](https://minerva.union.edu/hollochk/c_petrology/discrim.html)
and click on any blue link in it. This should download an `Excel` file
on your computer containing the anchor points of various binary and
ternary diagrams.

1. Your job is to use the coordinates in these `Excel` files to
produce lines, polygons and labels that reproduce the various plots on
the website. I have already finished implementing several diagrams,
whose `json` files you can inspect at
[`github:pvermees/GeoplotR/inst/`](https://github.com/pvermees/GeoplotR/tree/main/inst). I
would like you to make some more of these, notably:

   (a) Meschede, 1986

   (b) Pearce and Cann, 1973 (except the Ti-Zr-Y diagram, which has
     already been implemented)

   (c) Wood, 1980

   (d) Ewart, 1982

   (e) Winchester and Floyd, 1977

   (f) Cabanis and Lecolle, 1989

   (g) Mullen, 1983

   (h) Shervais, 1982

   (i) Pearce and Norry, 1979

1. The best way to build a `json` file is to open `Template.json`,
save it under a different name and modify its contents. Edit `test.R`
to test your `json` file. Test frequently to catch bugs. So: edit,
test, edit, test, ... until the diagram looks like the one in the
`Excel` file. I am happy to answer questions, but would advise that
you try to help each other as well.
